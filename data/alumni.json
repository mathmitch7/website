		"bio": "<p>An instrumentalist by trade, Geoff was brought to the Dark Side (by which he means a cappella) when he came to Olin. Originally a classically trained pianist, Geoff spent most of his years playing bass for jazz bands and his high-school orchestra. He had not done very much singing until he joined PowerChords his freshman year, but now he is thrilled to be singing all the time. Geoff is super enthusiastic about PowerChords, and is really excited that he has the opportunity to co-direct the group this year. When he is not singing, he enjoys playing guitar and bass, nerding out about advanced music theory, running, biking, adventuring, and being a snob about coffee.</p>",

He also somehow fits in school work, but that's less important. He spends his summers working in the forests of northern Minnesota, serving on the frontlines of the never ending war against the vegetative scourge of the earth known as trees.</p>",

He plays 4.5 instruments, practices lucid dreaming, and if you could get him to sit still long enough he would probably tell you that he enjoys parkour, programming in Python, and all things Italian.</p>",
