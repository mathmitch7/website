He never sang in an a cappella group prior to joining PowerChords and is excited about the opportunity! In addition to singing, Kyle likes to play French horn, piano, chess, soccer, and clown around with friends. He fits in learning about engineering, too, somewhere.</p>",

She hails from the northern land of Montreal, Canada but has recently been relocated to Kailua, HI. Though never formally trained, Ingrid has been part of various singing groups including a Scottish a cappella group, choir in high school, and has performed various solos, including her senior year closing song. When not singing, Ingrid likes to eat fine foods (om nom nom), run, sew, and talk about not talking. She is ready to rock y'all!</p>",

He hasn’t done much singing outside of the shower until joining PowerChords. He’s probably going to major in robotics engineering, because robots are just the coolest. Apart from music, Alex is extremely enthusiastic about robotics, bad puns, and lookin’ good. He will never skip a beat when it comes to terrible jokes or putting on a bow tie just for fun.</p>",
